# Perceptron Model: Predicting High-Fare Uber Rides

## 🔍 a. Algorithm Description

This module implements the **Perceptron algorithm**, a classic linear classifier for binary classification tasks. The model was implemented from scratch as part of the custom package `rice_ml`, which includes reusable components for training and evaluating machine learning models.

Key features:
- Batch Perceptron training with user-defined learning rate and number of iterations
- Custom evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy)
- Feature weight interpretation for model explainability

## 📊 b. Dataset Summary

The model is trained and tested on a sample of the **NYC Uber trip dataset**, which includes:

- Pickup/dropoff locations (latitude & longitude)
- Pickup datetime
- Passenger count
- Fare amount (used to define the binary label)

The binary classification task is to predict whether a ride is **high-fare** (`fare_amount > 15`) or not. After cleaning and feature engineering, the dataset includes engineered features such as:
- Manhattan distance
- Hour of day (exact)
- Day of week
- Weekend indicator
- Interaction term: `hour_exact × passenger_count`

## 🧪 c. Instructions to Reproduce

1. **Clone the project and set up package path** in your Colab or local environment:

```python
!git clone https://github.com/alicewang777/INDE577_ML_Rice_2025.git
import sys
sys.path.append('/content/INDE577_ML_Rice_2025')
```

2. **Import the Perceptron model from the custom package:**

```python
from rice_ml.perceptron import Perceptron
```

3. **Load and preprocess the dataset** using the included notebook. Make sure to:
   - Filter invalid coordinates
   - Convert pickup time to datetime
   - Create the binary label (`fare_amount > 15`)
   - Scale features using `StandardScaler`

4. **Train and evaluate the model**:

```python
model = Perceptron(learning_rate=0.0005, n_iters=2000)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
```

5. **Evaluate performance** using accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix, and feature weights.
