## Notebook: `rice_ml_package.ipynb`

This notebook demonstrates how to:

- Build the `rice_ml` package dynamically in Google Colab
- Test model training and prediction on a small dataset
- Set up the package for reuse in other notebooks

It is especially useful for verifying that the models are importable and functional across files, simulating real package usage.
